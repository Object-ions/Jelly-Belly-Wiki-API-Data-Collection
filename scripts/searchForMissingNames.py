# To accomplish the task of comparing the list of flavors from 'beans_name_list.json' with the entries in 'merged_98_beans.json', and identifying any missing flavors, here's the approach I'll take:

# Read Data from JSON Files: I'll read the contents of 'beans_name_list.json' and 'merged_98_beans.json'. The first file will provide a list of all expected flavor names, and the second file will contain the actual entries.

# Normalize Flavor Names: Since there's a naming difference (e.g., "GlazedBlueberryCake" vs. "GLAZED BLUEBERRY CAKE"), I need to normalize these names to ensure accurate comparison. This will likely involve converting all names to a common case (e.g., lowercase) and removing non-alphanumeric characters (like spaces and punctuation).

# Compare Flavors: With normalized names, I'll compare the list of expected flavors against the actual flavors in 'merged_98_beans.json'. I'll check which names from 'beans_name_list.json' are not present in 'merged_98_beans.json'.

# Output Missing Flavors: Finally, I'll output the list of missing flavor names to the terminal.

# This approach ensures that despite the differences in naming conventions, the comparison will be accurate, and you'll get a list of any flavors that are present in 'beans_name_list.json' but missing in 'merged_98_beans.json'.

import json

# Function to read JSON file
def read_json(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

# Normalize flavor names for comparison
def normalize_name(name):
    return ''.join(filter(str.isalnum, name)).lower()

# Read data from JSON files
flavor_list = read_json('beans_name_list.json')
merged_beans = read_json('merged_98_beans.json')

# Extract and normalize flavor names from merged_beans
merged_flavors = set(normalize_name(bean['FlavorName']) for bean in merged_beans)

# Check for missing flavors
missing_flavors = []
for flavor in flavor_list:
    if normalize_name(flavor) not in merged_flavors:
        missing_flavors.append(flavor)

# Display missing flavors
print("Missing Flavors:")
for flavor in missing_flavors:
    print(flavor)
