# Input File: The script will read from a file named scrapeRecipe.txt. This file contains arrays of ingredients and a resulting product, formatted as strings.

# Data Format: Each array in the file represents a recipe. The elements of the array are ingredients, denoted by strings. The '+' sign is used to separate ingredients, and the '=' sign precedes the name of the final product.

# Transformation:

# The script will convert each array into a structured format.
# The '+' signs will be retained to concatenate the ingredients.
# The '=' sign will be omitted.
# The last element in the array (after the '=') is considered the name of the recipe.
# Each transformed recipe will be encapsulated in a new Recipe structure with three attributes: RecipeId, Name, and Combination.
# RecipeId will be a sequential integer starting from 1 and incrementing for each recipe.
# Name will be the final product's name (the last element in the array).
# Combination will be a string composed of the ingredients concatenated with '+' signs.
# Output Format: The transformed data will be outputted in the specified structure. This should be save to a file name : prepRecipeToSeed.txt
